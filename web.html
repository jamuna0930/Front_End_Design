            <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to 
                be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
                 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage 
                and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a 
                web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

            <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br> With HTML constructs, 
                images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
                 HTML provides a means to create structured documents by <br>denoting structural semantics for text such as
                  headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br>
                 HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>

            <p>Tags such as directly introduce content into the page.<br>
                 Other tags such as surround and provide information about
                 document text and may include othe tags as sub-elements.<br>
                 Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

            <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript,
                 which affects the behavior and content of web pages.<br>
                 Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.</p>
